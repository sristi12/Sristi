1
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,588
Uh-huh. Move, move, move.

2
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:21,130
Father!

3
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:23,755
John! John!

4
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:58,338
<i>No one is responsible
for the death of this man.</i>

5
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:04,255
God alone has decided
to take John Kamkwamba.

6
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,921
When God has decided,
then we will know the man by what remains.

7
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:14,755
By the fruit shall we know the tree.

8
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,463
And we have fruit here.

9
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:24,546
The fruit of the land farmed by John
and his younger brother, Trywell,

10
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,421
since they returned from Dowa
nearly 20 years ago,

11
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:32,380
and worked this land together
side by side, these two brothers.

12
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,338
But there are other fruits
from John Kamkwamba,

13
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,005
many offspring born to him.

14
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:44,880
His children,
led by his eldest son, Jeremiah,

15
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:48,838
who must now take over the work
of his departed father.

16
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:53,588
And if the fruit is good, then it must...

17
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:14,171
William.

18
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:15,911
Give me my radio.

19
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,296
Did you fix Mr. Bamusi's?

20
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:24,796
No, sir. Not yet.

21
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:28,046
Go and check the roof.

22
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:39,088
<i>There are heavy cloud
formations moving across the southwest...</i>

23
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,380
- Morning, Papa.
- Sleep better?

24
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:33,088
Put it on his bed.

25
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:42,314
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

26
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:49,088
- Bad dreams again?
- Yes, hardly slept.

27
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:05,046
William! You want Shabani to help you?

28
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,838
No, Ma. I'm fine.

29
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,880
William, where's my radio?

30
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:16,463
Mr. Bamusi, please,
just a few more days.

31
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,505
I'm finding the problem.
It's not the condenser.

32
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:21,588
I've told your father.
I'm missing my programs, William.

33
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:23,505
William, if you can't fix it,

34
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,713
you have to give Mr. Bamusi
back his money.

35
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,963
A few days, Mr. Bamusi. I promise.

36
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:31,380
He's forcing me to come back from work
and talk to my wife and children.

37
00:08:31,463 --> 00:08:32,880
William.

38
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:35,546
Make sure you wash
before you go inside.

39
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,630
Yes, Ma.

40
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:30,921
Papa! Papa!

41
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:32,380
Hey!

42
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:38,630
Thank you, Papa! Thank you!

43
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:43,796
Oh, my God! Where is my son?
Who has taken my son?

44
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,130
- Look at the trousers!
- It's okay. It's okay.

45
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:48,421
Who brought this man here?

46
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,213
Doesn't he know that I love my husband?

47
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:52,838
Leave the boy alone.

48
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:57,171
Is he a doctor from Lilongwe
or an engineer from Chimamba?

49
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,630
- It's not too big?
- It's perfect.

50
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,505
Dear Father,

51
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:06,463
we thank you for all the blessings
you have laid on this family.

52
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:11,963
Please continue to fight for us,
so we may endure any hardship.

53
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,171
- In Jesus's name, Amen.
- Amen.

54
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:30,630
When I was a boy, the elders sometimes
hadn't recorded everyone's exact age.

55
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,463
But there was a simple test.

56
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:39,130
If you could touch your left ear
over your head with your right hand,

57
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:41,130
you could go to school.

58
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,338
The first time I tried, I was too small.

59
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,546
I couldn't reach.

60
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:51,255
Do it.

61
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:55,380
That was for you to go
to primary school, Papa.

62
00:10:58,005 --> 00:11:00,130
- Of course I can do it.
- I know.

63
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:11,213
Go to school.

64
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:17,921
Gilbert.

65
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,130
Gilbert.

66
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,338
Hey!

67
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:28,671
- Looking sharp, man.
- You too, man.

68
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,564
I think this is
a bit too loose for you.

69
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:35,713
Room to grow, room to grow.

70
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,171
One phosphorus, one more organic.

71
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:45,838
- You want an ox cart?
- No, I brought the bike.

72
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:49,880
There's flooding in Mozambique.

73
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Mozambique?

74
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,505
I've heard it on the radio.

75
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,088
Justina's relatives found
her a job at the agricultural ministry.

76
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:07,880
Don't worry.

77
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:15,296
After university,
you'll have no problem finding a job.

78
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:21,380
You'll do things
even I didn't think women could do.

79
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,921
N.U.P. government! N.U.P. government!

80
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,171
Another six months of this bullshit.

81
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:35,296
You know the president
is even coming to Kasungu.

82
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:40,005
Democracy.

83
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:44,713
Democracy is just like imported cassava.

84
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:49,546
It rots quickly.

85
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:29,046
Of course, Kachokolo is not
the wealthiest school in the district,

86
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:34,005
but it's down to each one of you
to decide your own level of commitment.

87
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:37,296
- Your own level of what?
- Commitment!

88
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,880
We have had students excel
in their junior certificate

89
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:49,755
and some of them
have even gone on to university.

90
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:51,921
Did these people have two heads?

91
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,088
No, Mr. Headmaster.

92
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:57,255
- What did they not have?
- Two heads!

93
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,338
They worked hard.
Simple as that. What did they do?

94
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:03,796
Worked hard.

95
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:06,796
When we have received
the full payment for the term,

96
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:09,921
you will receive your library card
from Mrs. Sikelo.

97
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:12,130
What will I give you?

98
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:14,130
Library cards.

99
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:21,796
Your library cards will allow you
to take some books home overnight.

100
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:25,046
So, with dedication, there's no reason...

101
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:27,421
Everybody, go to your form rooms.

102
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:31,380
Your form teachers will take you through
the rest of the day's activities.

103
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,671
Everybody, find your seat.
Find your seat.

104
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:46,505
Your first day of school
and the rains have come.

105
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,338
A good sign, I wonder.

106
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:50,838
My name is Mr. Kachigunda.

107
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,588
I will be your form tutor
and science teacher for the year.

108
00:14:56,713 --> 00:15:00,963
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Kachigunda.

109
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:02,380
Take your seats.

110
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,755
Okay, let's get right on with it.
Basic algebra: <i>x </i>and <i>y.</i>

111
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,128
Mr. Godsten.

112
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,838
Mama said that Justina left for Lilongwe.

113
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,380
Yes, she's gone.

114
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:20,296
Do you need help here?

115
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:22,588
Not any we can afford.

116
00:15:25,963 --> 00:15:28,755
Will you let me know
if you hear of any work in the market?

117
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:29,838
Of course.

118
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:45,255
Mr. Kachigunda.

119
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:50,046
It's from my sister, Annie,
for her university placement.

120
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,505
You're William Kamkwamba?

121
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:55,005
Yes, sir.

122
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,088
Tell your father to pay the fees.

123
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:02,546
He's paid, sir.

124
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,505
Only the down payment.
There's no grace period here.

125
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:09,631
Tell your father to pay the rest
or you won't be allowed to come to school.

126
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,546
Yes, sir. He'll pay, sir.

127
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:16,671
Good.

128
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,421
William, look who's been waiting.

129
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:28,046
Khamba!

130
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,296
William, it's too dark.

131
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:08,963
We have a science test.

132
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:13,421
- Can I use kerosene?
- There's not enough for studying.

133
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,213
Go and help your father plant.

134
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:22,796
That's okay.

135
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:25,421
You need to see me after class.

136
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,463
William, you can do better.
Gilbert, I'm not so sure.

137
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:32,421
That's good.

138
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:35,796
- At least you passed.
- Sixty-two is not enough.

139
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,463
We need to go to the junkyard.
We need to find a way to study at night.

140
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:42,671
There's been a delivery.

141
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,546
It's just more shit
from the tobacco estate.

142
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,338
Anything new?

143
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,671
It's a pump.

144
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,130
Hey!

145
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:34,463
<i>When the tobacco estates moved south,</i>

146
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:38,921
<i>it made it hard for us to compete
to grow tobacco.</i>

147
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:44,588
And then they took the trees to burn
to dry their tobacco leaves.

148
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:51,796
We once had a beautiful country
that my son will never see.

149
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,630
We have been instructed by the estate

150
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,046
to offer 2,000 kwacha
per tonne of forestry.

151
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:03,546
Papa, what's going on?
They're taking the trees?

152
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,046
Who said you could come to the meeting?

153
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,588
Gilbert is allowed.

154
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,463
And so? Go!

155
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:12,588
Go!

156
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:16,005
Of course, if you don't
want to take this opportunity,

157
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,463
we will be forced
to take our business elsewhere.

158
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:22,963
Let the chief speak.
Let the chief speak.

159
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Of course, the estates know
that the rains came late this year,

160
00:19:27,963 --> 00:19:29,421
and they have come heavy.

161
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:32,380
They know that there has been flooding
in Mozambique.

162
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:37,088
They know that without finances,
we can't build proper defenses,

163
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:39,046
and so we rely on the trees.

164
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:43,130
They watch for every pressure
on us small people,

165
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,046
so they can take from us.

166
00:19:46,963 --> 00:19:50,338
The only power we have is to say no.

167
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,338
This is a gross mischaracterization
of the estate's agenda.

168
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,380
We want to work with you people.

169
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,505
I'll sign.

170
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:02,921
- Company man, I will sign.
- For 2,000?

171
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,630
- I'll sign.
- Jeremiah.

172
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,505
Listen to the chief.

173
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:10,713
Listen to the chief.
Two thousand is not enough.

174
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:13,630
The chief can decide his own.
I can decide my own.

175
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,630
This is madness. We need the money.
I will sign.

176
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,963
Who else will sign with Jeremiah?

177
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:26,046
We can only guarantee this price
for today.

178
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:28,963
Jeremiah.

179
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:32,671
Think of your families.

180
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:36,838
I'll sign.

181
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,713
I'll sign.

182
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,450
<i>These trees protect us from flooding.</i>

183
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:06,921
Why do you think
your father never sold them?

184
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,088
We'll make more money this way.

185
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,921
There's flooding in Mozambique.

186
00:21:13,296 --> 00:21:14,296
Mozambique?

187
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:16,921
I have debts in Kasungu.

188
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:18,796
Then stop gambling.

189
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,546
Don't worry, Uncle Trywell.

190
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:29,546
I'll support you and your family,
just like my father did.

191
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:33,421
You keep spending your money
educating your kids,

192
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,255
just so they can leave you.

193
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,671
The smart ones
will get the hell out of here.

194
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:41,338
And I promise you,

195
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:44,213
when I have enough money to go,

196
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:46,088
I'll give you my land.

197
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,796
I don't want your land.

198
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,380
Then my father was right...

199
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:00,630
not to leave it to you.

200
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,005
There's nothing wrong with gambling.

201
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:08,081
Look at how these rains have been
these last few years.

202
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,005
We're all gambling.

203
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:15,481
Stay, Khamba.

204
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,460
I asked her why they
would send a beautiful woman down here.

205
00:24:33,546 --> 00:24:36,005
She started smiling like this...

206
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:41,796
So, what happened?

207
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,296
What did you do with her?

208
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:47,005
You people let children in here now?

209
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:48,713
He's got brains.

210
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:51,546
So? How can I talk in front of children?

211
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:53,088
Which children?

212
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:55,213
What do you know about women?

213
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:57,296
I know absolutely everything you know.

214
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,963
Oh!

215
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:03,338
What is it?

216
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:14,005
I told you. These batteries are dying.

217
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:16,255
- You have more?
- They're all dead.

218
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:19,088
The game's starting. What do we do now?

219
00:25:34,796 --> 00:25:36,588
Annie, is that you?

220
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
No.

221
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:43,421
Papa.

222
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:45,963
Should I take my fees with me
to school tomorrow morning?

223
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:51,546
When the rains stop,

224
00:25:52,255 --> 00:25:55,005
and we're sure of the harvest,
we'll pay the fees.

225
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:56,838
- But sir...
- You were at the meeting.

226
00:25:58,296 --> 00:25:59,796
They're taking down the trees.

227
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:02,005
The land could flood.

228
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:13,171
Radios use a lot of power,

229
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:17,213
so when the batteries die,
there's usually a bit of juice at the end.

230
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,755
So if we put a few dead ones together...

231
00:26:25,713 --> 00:26:26,880
Yes!

232
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,713
<i>...took place at 8:46 a.m.</i>

233
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,630
<i>And the second plane
struck the South Tower</i>

234
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:36,921
<i>at 9:03 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.</i>

235
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,505
<i>- The American president, George W. Bush...</i>
- Find the game!

236
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:14,296
Look! Look!

237
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:18,630
It's Mr. Kachigunda and your sister.

238
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,630
Did you know?

239
00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:39,713
No.

240
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:44,838
- You can't tell anyone about this.
- I won't.

241
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,738
What are you going to do?

242
00:27:56,005 --> 00:27:57,671
You can't just let him get away with it.

243
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,713
What if he disgraces her
and tells everybody?

244
00:28:04,255 --> 00:28:05,755
Let me check the car battery.

245
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,130
- It's dead.
- Let me check.

246
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,713
Is that how
she was able to attend senior classes?

247
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:15,171
What do you mean?

248
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:18,588
He was her teacher.

249
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:21,421
He must have helped her.

250
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:25,505
That's why she got the grades
for university,

251
00:28:25,588 --> 00:28:28,005
and we're struggling even to get
a junior certificate.

252
00:28:29,338 --> 00:28:31,755
She got good grades
because she studied at night.

253
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,255
I remember.
We had had money for kerosene back then.

254
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:41,338
You could use this.

255
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:43,755
To do what?

256
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:47,921
If you break his bike, you think
he'll walk all the way to the village?

257
00:28:55,338 --> 00:28:56,838
- It's this one.
- Yeah, that's it.

258
00:29:02,838 --> 00:29:04,796
- I can't.
- Huh?

259
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:08,588
Take the light.

260
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:12,380
Take it,
and then you'll be able to study at night.

261
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:24,213
It's not coming off.

262
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:40,713
Turn the pedal.

263
00:29:51,046 --> 00:29:52,046
Stop.

264
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,338
Start again.

265
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,463
Khamba.

266
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:47,421
- I had 5,200.
- Is that everything?

267
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:51,463
William's schooling?

268
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:54,213
After the harvest.

269
00:30:54,755 --> 00:30:56,546
He needs schooling, Trywell.

270
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,171
You want him spending time
with those useless boys?

271
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,255
His mind is just like Annie's.

272
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:08,838
- Like my mother's.
- Your mother's? That mad woman.

273
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,421
Was it madness
when she came and built the extension?

274
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:15,671
Making bricks all day at her age
is what killed her.

275
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:17,921
And we still use it.

276
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,630
The children get it from her.

277
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
From my side.

278
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:27,755
Not from mine?

279
00:31:28,796 --> 00:31:32,213
You're clever enough.
You found me, didn't you?

280
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:38,880
That was just luck.

281
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:42,713
Just because you were
in the marketplace that time.

282
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:51,046
We need to save everything we can.

283
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:53,880
There's no money for school fees.

284
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:56,171
Not right now.

285
00:32:12,505 --> 00:32:15,963
Phiri, Nyangu, Kamchulu,

286
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:20,546
Muzombe, Lukwa, Kamanga,

287
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:23,921
Kamkwamba, and Nkhoma.

288
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:27,338
If your name has been called,
please stay here.

289
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:30,088
Everyone else, go to class.

290
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,088
Your school fees have still not been paid.

291
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:49,005
There is no grace period.

292
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:54,463
Please go home and collect the fees
if you wish to continue your studies.

293
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:06,921
Trywell.

294
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:10,213
I'll go to the
auction house. I'll talk to Daniel Ngwata.

295
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:11,713
Daniel?

296
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:14,838
You haven't seen him for years.

297
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,130
Maybe he can talk to the estate.

298
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:14,755
How do you know this man, Papa?

299
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,338
An old friend.

300
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:23,005
Trywell.

301
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,588
- So long. Too long.
- Good to see you.

302
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:29,755
Is this big man William?
Wow. It's been too long.

303
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,088
This way, please.

304
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:39,380
I have some small savings
from when we were in business in Dowa.

305
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:43,588
But I can use some of it
to buy back the trees on Kamkwamba land

306
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:45,130
for the price they were bought for.

307
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:46,213
They won't do that.

308
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:49,505
No, if you tell them the land is flooding.

309
00:35:51,338 --> 00:35:52,463
We're losing the harvest.

310
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:56,463
Trywell, they won't do that.
Why would they do that?

311
00:35:59,463 --> 00:36:01,671
Jeremiah sold the trees.

312
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:05,838
Why didn't your brother
leave you that land?

313
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:09,921
- You worked hard on that land.
- I don't know.

314
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:12,995
He should have left it to you
to take care of the family.

315
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:20,130
It was John's land to leave
to whoever he wants to leave it to.

316
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:26,505
The Pope.

317
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:28,671
The Pope.

318
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:31,921
That's what we used to call your father
back then.

319
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:35,046
The most honest man in all of Dowa market.

320
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:37,630
We used to laugh at him

321
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:40,546
because what good can come
from an honest businessman?

322
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:43,880
We used to laugh at him,
until he had carried off

323
00:36:43,963 --> 00:36:46,380
the most beautiful woman
in the whole place.

324
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:48,505
For farming.

325
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,128
For farming.

326
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:55,921
How is Agnes?

327
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:04,880
Can you help us, Daniel?

328
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,505
The rains, Trywell.

329
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,588
What can anybody do about these rains?

330
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,713
This year, the land is too wet.
Next year, too dry.

331
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:30,546
You can't do business like that.

332
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:35,671
All indications have been
that the grain harvest

333
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:37,046
would be good this year.

334
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,421
Even the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank,

335
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:43,380
told the government
to sell all the excess grain

336
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:44,588
to Mozambique and Kenya.

337
00:37:45,755 --> 00:37:46,838
And so they did.

338
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,588
Now what's happened? The floods have come.

339
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,338
And no one knows if there is enough grain
in this whole country

340
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:54,838
to protect the farmers.

341
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:57,463
The government will protect the farmers.

342
00:38:00,505 --> 00:38:02,755
Terrorists have attacked America.

343
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:05,588
You must have heard it.

344
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:08,421
All the markets are in free fall.

345
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,963
All these government debts being recalled.

346
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:16,796
Forget about the trees.

347
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,796
Forget about the savings.

348
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:25,546
When these rains stop and the sun returns,

349
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:30,380
Malawi is preparing
for a very long hungry season.

350
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:08,356
<i>The roots are all weak,</i>

351
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,338
<i>and now the sun is drying out the land,</i>

352
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:14,421
but when the president comes to Kasungu,
there will be journalists there,

353
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:16,088
and other chiefs.

354
00:39:17,546 --> 00:39:18,755
You could say something.

355
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:21,130
We can't threaten the president.

356
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:23,005
It's not threats.

357
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,921
We have to protect ourselves.

358
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:27,647
You just let them know
that we know what is happening.

359
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:30,022
Do you think the government
will leave everyone here to die?

360
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:31,446
I don't know,

361
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:33,880
but why should we sit here
waiting to find out?

362
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:47,630
There was a problem before, 20 years ago.

363
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:50,213
People ran out of food.

364
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:53,755
Chief fed them with what he could.

365
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:56,213
He saved a lot of people.

366
00:39:57,005 --> 00:40:00,088
He'll make sure
it doesn't get that bad again.

367
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:02,921
And if our harvest is okay,

368
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:06,046
we'll finish paying
for William's schooling.

369
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,255
And university?

370
00:40:13,796 --> 00:40:14,796
I don't know.

371
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:23,755
How did you know
Papa was the man you'd marry?

372
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:29,838
Is someone talking to you?

373
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,588
No, I'm just curious.

374
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:36,838
There's no one for you in Wimbe.

375
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:39,713
I know.

376
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:43,546
Annie, we'll get you off to university.

377
00:40:44,796 --> 00:40:47,005
You won't just be a wife and mother.

378
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:51,171
No one's been talking?

379
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:54,630
No one's been talking.

380
00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:00,973
I found another battery.

381
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,921
It's dead,
but if you take out the bad cells,

382
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:10,338
and connect the positive and negative
with this one,

383
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:12,671
we can make a good battery.

384
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:17,630
But it needs to charge.
It needs electricity.

385
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:20,880
With electricity, we can fix the pump.

386
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:24,505
We never know what's happening
with the rain.

387
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:11,255
What are you doing?

388
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:13,058
All I have to do is skip assembly.

389
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,088
I'll only go to science class for now.

390
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:17,093
Class, make sure
your homework of exercise three

391
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,213
is on my desk at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.

392
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,838
Mr. Kachigunda.

393
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,046
William.

394
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:28,755
When you turn the wheel on your bike,
the light shines.

395
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:31,296
- Yes.
- How?

396
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:33,380
A dynamo.

397
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:36,713
How does a dynamo work?

398
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:41,296
There's a little man on the inside
who rubs his hands together...

399
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,671
It's, uh, magnets.

400
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:48,421
- Where can I find a dynamo?
- You should try the trading center.

401
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:52,505
I'm not sure if they'll have one there.
Mine came from Lilongwe.

402
00:42:52,963 --> 00:42:56,380
Well, what would I need to make one?

403
00:42:56,963 --> 00:42:59,421
I'm not sure exactly. A few things.

404
00:43:00,296 --> 00:43:04,213
Uh, a magnet, wiring,
something to break the magnetic field.

405
00:43:04,713 --> 00:43:07,088
If you try the library,
maybe you will find something there.

406
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,296
I don't have a library card.

407
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:15,630
Because your parents haven't paid.

408
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:22,713
How do you know I will not tell Mr. Ofesi
that you're coming to my class?

409
00:43:26,796 --> 00:43:28,380
Because I can keep a secret, sir.

410
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:30,338
A secret?

411
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:31,588
Yes, sir.

412
00:43:33,421 --> 00:43:36,921
There is a man who comes to my village
to see my sister...

413
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:40,046
sir.

414
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,338
- Mr. Kachigunda.
- Mrs. Sikelo.

415
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,171
This is William Kamkwamba.
He's part of my science class.

416
00:43:56,005 --> 00:43:57,213
He's no longer a student here,

417
00:43:57,296 --> 00:43:59,505
but he and I have been working
on various experiments,

418
00:43:59,588 --> 00:44:02,148
and I'd like for him to continue
his studies here in the library.

419
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:10,380
- Does Mr. Ofesi know about this?
- Of course.

420
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:12,046
Mr. Ofesi's only stipulation

421
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:16,380
is the boy is not to be taught or assisted
by you or any other teacher.

422
00:44:16,963 --> 00:44:19,171
It's important to him
that the boy working here

423
00:44:19,255 --> 00:44:20,463
is not common knowledge.

424
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:23,713
He himself would prefer
not to be reminded of the fact.

425
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,380
Of course.

426
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:29,421
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

427
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:36,380
Perhaps you should sit
away from the window.

428
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,130
Ms. Sikelo.

429
00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:54,671
Mr. Kamkwamba.

430
00:44:56,088 --> 00:44:58,671
Are there any books on dynamos?

431
00:44:59,088 --> 00:45:00,088
Dynamos?

432
00:45:01,338 --> 00:45:02,838
Magnets and electricity?

433
00:45:03,755 --> 00:45:05,171
Is this in your class grade?

434
00:45:07,713 --> 00:45:09,463
Maybe I can work with a dictionary.

435
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:12,588
All the senior textbooks
are on the bottom shelf on the left.

436
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,713
Mr. Kamkwamba?
Did you find what you were looking for?

437
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:49,130
- Welcome, Mr. President.
- Thank you very much. How are you?

438
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:04,255
Thank you for coming Mr. President.
Welcome.

439
00:47:06,296 --> 00:47:08,671
Thank you, thank you.

440
00:47:09,046 --> 00:47:12,130
Clap your hands and cheer.

441
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:17,546
People, I'm saying N.U.P.

442
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:19,421
Government!

443
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:22,130
Say it three times.

444
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:27,130
N.U.P.!
N.U.P.! N.U.P.! Government!

445
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:33,505
Uh, but first of all,
I'd like to thank you, Your Excellency,

446
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,838
for honoring the inauguration
of Chief Mamba.

447
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,505
Can you please stand, Chief?

448
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,046
Yeah! Yeah!

449
00:47:44,713 --> 00:47:47,088
And now I'll leave the mic to Chief Wimbe.

450
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,921
Your Excellency,

451
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:09,380
may I first congratulate you
on your achievements in government,

452
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,046
and state that I hope
in the coming election,

453
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,088
you will emerge victorious.

454
00:48:18,171 --> 00:48:22,796
You have been a key factor
in our peace and stability,

455
00:48:24,213 --> 00:48:27,671
when we have seen
the responsibility of government

456
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,713
devolve into chaos across Africa.

457
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,088
However, the recent floods
have created a dangerous situation.

458
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:45,005
In many regions,
we already know the harvest will fail.

459
00:48:49,171 --> 00:48:54,255
We know the economic machinery
is not pointed towards us,

460
00:48:55,338 --> 00:48:58,296
but we are now a democracy.

461
00:48:58,671 --> 00:49:02,755
We are prepared to make our voices heard
in the ballot box.

462
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:07,463
- What is this man trying to do?
- We need an assurance of emergency grain.

463
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:13,255
We need to know any food issue
will be slaughtered in its infancy.

464
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:19,796
We need a government
prepared to support its people.

465
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:24,255
I want to vote for this government,

466
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,671
but cannot vote for any man

467
00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:33,213
who will turn two blind eyes
to a catastrophe.

468
00:49:37,338 --> 00:49:40,921
Democracy at work. Freedom of expression.

469
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:45,880
Well, His Excellency
will address this misunderstanding,

470
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:49,130
but for now, let's have some music.

471
00:49:58,046 --> 00:49:59,046
Gilbert!

472
00:50:19,421 --> 00:50:20,880
Father! Father!

473
00:50:25,338 --> 00:50:26,338
William!

474
00:50:30,463 --> 00:50:31,505
William!

475
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:56,171
Father! Father!

476
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:58,588
Father. Father!

477
00:50:59,463 --> 00:51:00,546
Father!

478
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:03,421
Father!

479
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,796
Father!

480
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:35,215
Why don't they take him to a clinic?

481
00:51:35,546 --> 00:51:36,546
He's safer here.

482
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:39,380
Would they come back?

483
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:43,338
We don't know.

484
00:51:45,755 --> 00:51:47,671
You have to be a man now, William.

485
00:51:49,713 --> 00:51:51,380
No one is coming to help us.

486
00:51:52,921 --> 00:51:54,921
I need you to work with me
on this harvest.

487
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,505
For every piece of grain we can get.

488
00:52:01,505 --> 00:52:02,505
Yes, sir.

489
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,630
Trywell.

490
00:52:35,546 --> 00:52:36,588
Thank you.

491
00:52:40,213 --> 00:52:41,796
Is that all there is?

492
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,880
It's not even five bags.

493
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:46,171
Sixty days.

494
00:52:47,588 --> 00:52:49,088
Sixty to seventy.

495
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:52,546
With a year till the next harvest.

496
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:54,463
It's not enough.

497
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,630
We have savings.

498
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,880
Trywell.

499
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,880
It's not enough.

500
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:45,916
The government is denying a food crisis.

501
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:48,005
What?

502
00:53:48,713 --> 00:53:52,005
They won't admit it's happening.

503
00:53:52,088 --> 00:53:54,046
<i>The corrupt government is only interested</i>

504
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,213
<i>in securing victory
in the coming election.</i>

505
00:53:56,296 --> 00:53:59,671
<i>We demand assurances from our leadership.</i>

506
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:03,838
<i>Tell us who will support our communities
when the food runs out?</i>

507
00:54:11,463 --> 00:54:13,838
There's an opposition rally in Nkhata Bay.

508
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:15,963
- They're getting a truck.
- Another rally?

509
00:54:16,213 --> 00:54:18,588
The opposition can put pressure
on the government.

510
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:22,421
- Where can we get the best price?
- I'll take care of it.

511
00:54:22,505 --> 00:54:24,171
- Uh-huh.
- You're going?

512
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,088
Papa!

513
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:27,380
The government doesn't want us
to make noise.

514
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:30,130
The opposition people need our support.

515
00:54:30,713 --> 00:54:34,380
Make noise here if you want to make noise.
Stay with your family.

516
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:37,255
We'll be back tonight.
Tomorrow at the latest.

517
00:54:39,546 --> 00:54:42,213
We need to make sure
people know what's happening here.

518
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:20,386
So, you use
the windmill to charge the battery?

519
00:55:21,046 --> 00:55:22,546
And the battery powers a pump.

520
00:55:23,255 --> 00:55:26,213
We can plant in the dry season.
Two harvests.

521
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,130
We can plant now
and we won't run out of food.

522
00:55:30,755 --> 00:55:33,046
With Mr. Kachigunda's dynamo, I can do it.

523
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:37,588
Go to his class.

524
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:39,546
Ask him.

525
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,171
I don't want you staying
in this village anymore.

526
00:55:44,546 --> 00:55:46,296
Not with all of these problems.

527
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,005
Where do you want me to go?

528
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:51,130
I have people in Mangochi.

529
00:55:51,755 --> 00:55:55,213
We can travel there and marry.

530
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:02,296
You want me to run away?

531
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:04,921
You want me to disgrace my family?

532
00:56:05,005 --> 00:56:07,231
I love you. I don't know
what's more important than this.

533
00:56:07,255 --> 00:56:09,755
We can come back
when I can pay them a bride price.

534
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:12,338
We'll do everything right then. I promise.

535
00:56:16,463 --> 00:56:18,296
Can you pay them a bride price now?

536
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:22,671
There's no money for teachers.

537
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,380
So many students are leaving
because of the harvest.

538
00:56:27,338 --> 00:56:28,671
They may close the school.

539
00:56:29,296 --> 00:56:32,171
There's nothing here for us.
There's nothing in Wimbe.

540
00:56:32,546 --> 00:56:33,546
Nothing for you.

541
00:56:35,296 --> 00:56:38,213
- You should go back to school.
- I don't care about school.

542
00:56:39,755 --> 00:56:41,880
We can leave now. I can arrange it. Annie.

543
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:44,713
- Annie.
- How can I go to Mangochi?

544
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,921
I can't even speak Yao.

545
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,755
They speak English in Mangochi,
and you can learn Yao.

546
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,921
Class, I'll be taking
your science lesson this morning.

547
00:57:10,171 --> 00:57:11,296
William Kamkwamba.

548
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:14,713
Stand up.

549
00:57:18,421 --> 00:57:19,505
My father will pay, sir.

550
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:24,088
You are stealing from the family
of every remaining student in this school.

551
00:57:24,171 --> 00:57:25,380
My father will pay, sir.

552
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:28,630
You're stealing from myself
and from every member of faculty.

553
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:30,171
My father will pay.

554
00:57:30,296 --> 00:57:31,880
You're expelled from Kachokolo,

555
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:34,338
and you will never be allowed
to study here again

556
00:57:34,505 --> 00:57:36,088
or any school in this district.

557
00:57:36,546 --> 00:57:39,005
- Collect your things and go.
- Mr. Ofesi.

558
00:57:39,713 --> 00:57:40,880
Collect your things and go!

559
00:57:53,505 --> 00:57:55,838
<i>There's nothing
I can do about it, Mrs. Sikelo.</i>

560
00:57:55,963 --> 00:57:58,338
I cannot ignore him
sneaking into the school.

561
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:02,255
But he was not sneaking into the school.

562
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:04,088
Don't you see, Mr. Ofesi?

563
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,463
Can you not see
that he's been sneaking out of the fields?

564
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:45,755
Have you seen your sister?

565
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:47,588
No.

566
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,630
They caught you at school?

567
00:58:52,588 --> 00:58:55,171
- You knew I was going?
- Of course.

568
00:58:57,921 --> 00:58:58,921
They expelled me.

569
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,880
Oh!

570
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,380
William.

571
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,880
- What's happening?
- They're taking grain to Chamama. To sell.

572
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:27,880
It's a government truck.
They're not leaving us to starve.

573
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,046
Buy grain. As much as you can.

574
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,880
It's government price, not market price.
It's cheaper.

575
00:59:45,963 --> 00:59:47,546
Aah! No, take the bike.

576
00:59:48,796 --> 00:59:50,671
Take the bike.

577
00:59:53,671 --> 00:59:55,880
Khamba, stay! It's too far.

578
00:59:58,463 --> 00:59:59,921
Khamba, stay.

579
01:00:41,796 --> 01:00:45,546
Grain! Grain! Grain!

580
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:06,130
Stop!

581
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:09,838
Stop!

582
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:11,630
Let's go back.

583
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,505
- Where were you?
- Seeing a friend.

584
01:01:26,505 --> 01:01:27,588
Which friend?

585
01:01:28,505 --> 01:01:30,838
You think I don't see you
sneaking out of here?

586
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:32,546
At night even?

587
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:34,713
- I've told you...
- I know.

588
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:36,338
What?

589
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,463
There's no one for me in Wimbe.

590
01:01:39,338 --> 01:01:40,963
There's nothing for me in Wimbe.

591
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,713
So if there's nothing for me in Wimbe,
why should I stay in Wimbe?

592
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:45,880
How can I stay?

593
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:06,338
- Who are you going with?
- That's not what I'm saying.

594
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:08,588
You want to disgrace your family?

595
01:02:10,255 --> 01:02:11,380
You don't understand.

596
01:02:12,046 --> 01:02:15,546
What do you think you know that I don't?

597
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,671
Madam, I haven't eaten in two days.

598
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,005
Get out.

599
01:02:25,088 --> 01:02:26,505
I don't want to hurt anyone.

600
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:32,421
They said to see the Chief...

601
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,171
but he's dying.

602
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:02,481
How much can they have?
There were only two trucks.

603
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,921
Back in line!
Back in line!

604
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:11,046
There will not be enough
for everyone today.

605
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:41,421
I can only give you fifteen kilos.

606
01:07:45,755 --> 01:07:48,338
Trywell! Trywell!

607
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:51,838
I told you not to go!

608
01:07:52,255 --> 01:07:54,338
- What happened?
- I told you not to go!

609
01:07:56,088 --> 01:07:58,213
- I told you not to go!
- Where's William?

610
01:07:58,296 --> 01:07:59,338
I don't know.

611
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:01,255
William! Where's William?

612
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:18,305
We can't just stay here.
We'll need to open the door.

613
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,546
You'll have to run.

614
01:08:34,046 --> 01:08:35,046
Sir.

615
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:36,171
Can you help me?

616
01:08:38,463 --> 01:08:39,463
Please.

617
01:09:19,796 --> 01:09:22,213
We can have one meal a day.

618
01:09:28,671 --> 01:09:30,380
We should decide which one.

619
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:34,130
This is crazy.

620
01:09:42,338 --> 01:09:43,338
Agnes?

621
01:09:47,546 --> 01:09:48,880
Supper.

622
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:52,713
You can't sleep on an empty stomach.

623
01:09:58,671 --> 01:09:59,671
William?

624
01:10:02,338 --> 01:10:03,338
Breakfast.

625
01:10:04,296 --> 01:10:05,296
Why?

626
01:10:06,671 --> 01:10:08,130
I like breakfast.

627
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:11,463
- My God!
- Annie!

628
01:10:14,796 --> 01:10:16,476
You don't raise your voice to your father.

629
01:10:16,505 --> 01:10:17,796
He left us here.

630
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,796
We could have been raped and killed.
If it wasn't for William...

631
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:34,755
Your father was trying to save us.

632
01:10:35,546 --> 01:10:37,588
- There's no food!
- And so?

633
01:10:39,713 --> 01:10:41,963
You think I'd let you starve to death?

634
01:10:45,296 --> 01:10:47,796
When I cut off my own arm to feed you,

635
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:51,338
then you'll know that you're my child.

636
01:12:35,171 --> 01:12:39,421
Tomorrow,
we'll dig ridges and start planting.

637
01:12:40,838 --> 01:12:43,130
The ground is too hard.
It's the dry season.

638
01:12:43,338 --> 01:12:45,046
Nothing will grow.

639
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:48,630
Then...

640
01:12:49,796 --> 01:12:51,088
we pray for rain.

641
01:12:52,755 --> 01:12:54,255
Dear Father,

642
01:12:56,088 --> 01:12:57,380
fight for this family.

643
01:12:58,338 --> 01:13:00,338
- Bring us rain in this dry season...
- Trywell.

644
01:13:00,796 --> 01:13:01,796
Stop.

645
01:13:10,588 --> 01:13:12,338
Eat, Papa.

646
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:42,463
If you give any food to that dog,

647
01:13:43,338 --> 01:13:44,546
I'll break your neck.

648
01:13:55,005 --> 01:13:56,546
Annie. Annie.

649
01:13:58,671 --> 01:14:01,630
- What is it?
- I need you to speak to Mr. Kachigunda.

650
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:08,796
I know you're talking to Mr. Kachigunda.

651
01:14:09,213 --> 01:14:11,213
I need to use the dynamo from his bike.

652
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:14,213
- The dynamo?
- You have to help me, Annie.

653
01:14:15,171 --> 01:14:17,255
Tell him he has to let me use the dynamo.

654
01:14:17,338 --> 01:14:19,546
I can fix a water pump.
I know how to do it.

655
01:14:19,963 --> 01:14:21,880
I can bring water. I can make rain.

656
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,755
But I need the dynamo.

657
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:55,630
Mama, what happened?

658
01:15:56,713 --> 01:15:58,463
She's gone with teacher.

659
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,796
Did you see her? Did you see her?

660
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,880
No, sir.

661
01:16:02,713 --> 01:16:03,713
Are you lying to me?

662
01:16:04,463 --> 01:16:06,671
- Where did they go?
- I don't know, sir.

663
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,713
Bring me my daughter, William.

664
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:12,880
- I don't know, sir. I don't know!
- Bring me my daughter!

665
01:16:13,546 --> 01:16:14,796
"One less."

666
01:16:16,213 --> 01:16:18,046
She says, "One less."

667
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:23,088
"One less mouth to feed."

668
01:16:37,338 --> 01:16:40,296
I'll do everything I can
to find an address, but right now...

669
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,796
We have no money to go to Mangochi.

670
01:16:45,463 --> 01:16:48,671
I'll do my best to locate Mr. Kachigunda.

671
01:16:49,796 --> 01:16:50,796
Your best?

672
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,463
I'm sorry, we're closing the school
for the moment.

673
01:16:54,505 --> 01:16:56,755
There are not enough students or teachers.

674
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,963
- Is Ms. Sikelo still here?
- No.

675
01:17:02,838 --> 01:17:05,921
This hunger will be the last one,

676
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:09,630
for me and my family, believe me.

677
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:14,421
We'll never go through
something like this again.

678
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,546
He's starving himself.

679
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:20,421
Killing himself.

680
01:17:21,546 --> 01:17:24,796
So he doesn't take food
from these children.

681
01:17:25,505 --> 01:17:26,338
Mrs. Kamkwamba...

682
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:28,880
When we were first married,
we promised each other

683
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:34,421
that we would never pray for rain
like our ancestors.

684
01:17:34,796 --> 01:17:36,505
We said we were modern people,

685
01:17:37,463 --> 01:17:39,296
and our children would go to school.

686
01:17:40,171 --> 01:17:43,671
And this is here that Annie met teacher,

687
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,880
and we paid for it.

688
01:17:47,713 --> 01:17:51,088
- And you even expelled my son.
- Not me, Mrs. Kamkwamba.

689
01:17:51,588 --> 01:17:53,421
- The government...
- Which government?

690
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,671
The government that beat our chief?

691
01:18:00,755 --> 01:18:05,088
Even if they prayed for rain,
the ancestors survived

692
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:07,588
because they stayed together.

693
01:18:19,005 --> 01:18:21,213
When do we stay together, Mr. Headmaster?

694
01:18:26,921 --> 01:18:28,921
What can I do, Mrs. Kamkwamba?

695
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,338
Can I use the library?

696
01:18:52,588 --> 01:18:53,838
What's all this?

697
01:18:54,255 --> 01:18:55,380
An experiment.

698
01:18:57,130 --> 01:19:00,213
In America, electricity made from wind.

699
01:19:01,005 --> 01:19:02,965
With electricity, we can make water.

700
01:19:03,463 --> 01:19:05,022
We're going to build a windmill.

701
01:19:05,046 --> 01:19:07,713
We need to build a small one first,
to see if it works.

702
01:19:07,796 --> 01:19:10,421
All I ate today was pigskin from the drum.

703
01:19:11,671 --> 01:19:12,963
Don't waste my time.

704
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,171
What do we do?

705
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:34,171
- It has a motor inside.
- It turns the cassette tape.

706
01:19:34,921 --> 01:19:36,881
How are you doing with those blades?

707
01:19:36,963 --> 01:19:38,463
I'm almost there.

708
01:19:56,838 --> 01:19:58,546
Okay, open the door.

709
01:20:33,713 --> 01:20:35,713
<i>♪ It's a clever bird ♪</i>

710
01:20:35,838 --> 01:20:38,463
<i>♪ It builds its nest ♪</i>

711
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:41,546
<i>♪ To protect the others... ♪</i>

712
01:21:12,296 --> 01:21:13,505
Papa.

713
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:16,921
I want to show you something.

714
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:43,046
Can you hear it?

715
01:21:47,963 --> 01:21:48,963
Uh-huh.

716
01:21:50,588 --> 01:21:51,588
What is it?

717
01:21:52,755 --> 01:21:54,088
It's wind energy.

718
01:21:54,838 --> 01:21:57,130
The blades make electricity,

719
01:21:57,796 --> 01:21:59,130
and that powers the radio.

720
01:22:01,796 --> 01:22:02,796
I see.

721
01:22:03,255 --> 01:22:09,171
I want to build a big one.
A big one could power a water pump.

722
01:22:09,796 --> 01:22:12,213
It means that even if the land is dry,

723
01:22:13,213 --> 01:22:16,838
we can still plant.

724
01:22:20,338 --> 01:22:21,338
It can do that?

725
01:22:23,005 --> 01:22:24,005
Yes.

726
01:22:25,088 --> 01:22:27,380
But to build a big one,

727
01:22:27,755 --> 01:22:29,921
I'll need something
to help turn the blades.

728
01:22:32,963 --> 01:22:35,838
If I could use your bike, it would work.

729
01:22:40,796 --> 01:22:41,796
The bike?

730
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:44,505
It would work.

731
01:22:49,421 --> 01:22:50,880
How long would you need it for?

732
01:22:53,671 --> 01:22:57,338
I'd need to remove the wheels
and cut the frame.

733
01:22:57,671 --> 01:23:00,171
You couldn't use it as a bike anymore.

734
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:05,630
What?

735
01:23:11,255 --> 01:23:12,255
William.

736
01:23:15,171 --> 01:23:17,171
Have you seen what's happening, William?

737
01:23:18,213 --> 01:23:19,213
Yes, sir.

738
01:23:20,463 --> 01:23:24,130
- People are dying. Do you understand?
- This will help everyone.

739
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:27,921
Get this stupidness away from me.

740
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,671
- Papa...
- Get this stupidness away from me!

741
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:36,463
Papa, I need to take the bike
so I can bring electricity.

742
01:23:36,921 --> 01:23:39,630
With electricity, I can make water.
I can make rain.

743
01:23:39,713 --> 01:23:40,838
Are you still talking?

744
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:46,671
There are things I know
that you don't know.

745
01:23:52,546 --> 01:23:54,796
Because you can make toys?

746
01:23:59,505 --> 01:24:01,005
Because of school.

747
01:24:05,213 --> 01:24:09,130
From now on, you get up with me
first thing in the morning, understand?

748
01:24:09,838 --> 01:24:12,088
You help me build these ridges.

749
01:24:12,338 --> 01:24:16,171
Forget about school!
Forget about the library!

750
01:24:16,338 --> 01:24:18,963
I don't want to see you
near this foolishness again!

751
01:24:19,671 --> 01:24:20,713
I was wrong!

752
01:24:22,296 --> 01:24:26,921
It's damn well time
you learned how to farm!

753
01:24:27,213 --> 01:24:28,213
Plow the land!

754
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,046
Plow the land!

755
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:24,546
- Are you okay?
- It's too hot.

756
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:27,255
Look at the sky.

757
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:31,755
It won't rain. It won't rain for months.

758
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,050
Do you think the Gule
Wamkulu will come when my father dies?

759
01:25:40,005 --> 01:25:41,463
Even though there's a hunger?

760
01:25:44,338 --> 01:25:46,463
They're supposed to come
when a chief dies.

761
01:26:09,963 --> 01:26:12,088
- Let's go.
- Where?

762
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,255
What's happening?

763
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,046
We have to go north while we still can.
There's nothing left.

764
01:26:22,338 --> 01:26:23,713
I need your help.

765
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:26,130
- If we stay, we die.
- No.

766
01:26:27,088 --> 01:26:29,213
We find another bike
and we build the windmill.

767
01:26:29,296 --> 01:26:31,171
You're mad. A bike from where?

768
01:26:31,421 --> 01:26:34,963
There's no one in the trading center.
Everyone is leaving the village.

769
01:26:35,046 --> 01:26:39,046
- It was a toy, William.
- It's not a toy. I showed you.

770
01:26:39,796 --> 01:26:41,880
What if there's no food in the north?

771
01:26:44,505 --> 01:26:45,630
You'll die.

772
01:26:47,213 --> 01:26:49,213
If you're sure it will work, William,

773
01:26:49,546 --> 01:26:51,421
why don't you just take
your father's bike?

774
01:26:52,255 --> 01:26:53,630
Why don't you just take it?

775
01:27:12,796 --> 01:27:13,796
Papa.

776
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,005
What's this?

777
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:33,130
We need to take the bike, Papa.

778
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,130
You want to fight me?

779
01:27:42,671 --> 01:27:46,588
We don't want to fight you, Trywell.
We just want you to give William the bike.

780
01:27:49,296 --> 01:27:50,296
William.

781
01:27:57,796 --> 01:27:58,880
Get away from my house.

782
01:27:59,296 --> 01:28:00,838
- He can bring water.
- You say.

783
01:28:01,338 --> 01:28:02,755
I can bring water.

784
01:28:03,463 --> 01:28:06,130
- All year round.
- You're a big man now, huh?

785
01:28:09,546 --> 01:28:10,546
Big men.

786
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:14,630
Fight me.

787
01:28:19,588 --> 01:28:20,755
Do it!

788
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:34,005
I'm your father!

789
01:28:36,338 --> 01:28:37,588
I'm your father!

790
01:28:48,421 --> 01:28:49,546
Wait.

791
01:28:51,005 --> 01:28:52,963
Come with us, William. Let's leave.

792
01:28:59,046 --> 01:29:00,213
I can't.

793
01:29:09,005 --> 01:29:10,005
I have to go home.

794
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:12,630
I need to be with my father.

795
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:21,671
Khamba, come.

796
01:30:31,338 --> 01:30:32,338
Khamba.

797
01:30:45,046 --> 01:30:46,130
Khamba.

798
01:31:41,505 --> 01:31:43,796
<i>He tried to fight me,</i>

799
01:31:44,838 --> 01:31:45,838
with his friends,

800
01:31:46,671 --> 01:31:48,255
for the bike.

801
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:50,963
Will you give it to him?

802
01:31:52,755 --> 01:31:53,880
Of course not.

803
01:32:14,963 --> 01:32:16,963
How much should I lose, Trywell?

804
01:32:20,171 --> 01:32:21,171
Huh?

805
01:32:22,796 --> 01:32:24,713
Everywhere I followed you,

806
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:26,838
I lost something.

807
01:32:29,338 --> 01:32:30,338
My parents,

808
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:32,880
when I came here.

809
01:32:35,296 --> 01:32:36,296
Then the land.

810
01:32:39,255 --> 01:32:40,296
Then we lost Annie.

811
01:32:43,505 --> 01:32:44,588
You're blaming me?

812
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,046
I'm not blaming you.

813
01:32:52,671 --> 01:32:53,671
I'm asking you.

814
01:32:56,338 --> 01:32:59,421
When do we stop losing?

815
01:33:02,213 --> 01:33:04,046
Nothing we have done has worked.

816
01:34:24,046 --> 01:34:25,963
John said we'd grow tobacco.

817
01:34:29,255 --> 01:34:33,296
Tobacco that looked like milk chocolate,

818
01:34:35,713 --> 01:34:37,338
for 2,000 kwacha a kilo.

819
01:34:41,005 --> 01:34:42,005
I'm sorry, Papa.

820
01:34:43,963 --> 01:34:45,255
Sometimes it's dreams,

821
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:49,588
and sometimes it's just lies.

822
01:34:52,005 --> 01:34:53,463
It's not a dream, Papa.

823
01:34:56,713 --> 01:34:58,046
I'm not dreaming.

824
01:35:03,046 --> 01:35:05,505
That's why he didn't leave the land to me.

825
01:35:09,255 --> 01:35:10,671
He didn't trust me.

826
01:35:12,005 --> 01:35:13,005
He never did.

827
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:18,588
He knew I'd fail.

828
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:21,921
Like I have.

829
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:27,588
You didn't fail me. Never.

830
01:35:29,171 --> 01:35:30,296
I went to school.

831
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:44,713
Water?

832
01:35:46,296 --> 01:35:47,296
Yes, sir.

833
01:35:51,338 --> 01:35:52,338
From wind?

834
01:35:54,713 --> 01:35:55,921
It can work,

835
01:35:58,005 --> 01:35:59,421
if you help me.

836
01:36:11,088 --> 01:36:12,088
Okay.

837
01:37:43,421 --> 01:37:45,171
You can bring it up. I'm ready.

838
01:38:00,505 --> 01:38:02,025
Have you got it?

839
01:38:09,505 --> 01:38:10,630
Be careful, William.

840
01:39:42,755 --> 01:39:45,171
It needs to charge.
The battery needs to charge.

841
01:41:05,838 --> 01:41:10,338
Go to the chief's house
and bring seeds. We'll plant vegetables.

842
01:41:17,546 --> 01:41:20,671
We'll get through
while we wait for the grain to grow.

843
01:43:41,963 --> 01:43:43,338
Go to them, Gilbert.

844
01:44:30,296 --> 01:44:33,463
Mrs. Sikelo wants to bring
the new government's representative

845
01:44:34,046 --> 01:44:36,255
for the schools district
to see the windmill.

846
01:44:38,463 --> 01:44:41,380
She says there may be a scholarship
for a school in Madisi.

847
01:44:44,921 --> 01:44:47,546
I think I should stay here.

848
01:44:48,796 --> 01:44:52,421
At least till Annie comes back.

849
01:44:53,088 --> 01:44:55,588
I think I should stay
and help you with the land.

850
01:45:01,755 --> 01:45:04,005
I've been thinking about this machine,
William.

851
01:45:06,588 --> 01:45:09,088
I've been thinking about
how it will carry you away

852
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:10,921
and keep you here at the same time.

853
01:45:13,005 --> 01:45:15,755
Because no one can see this thing
and not think of you.

854
01:45:17,338 --> 01:45:19,463
No one would want to.

855
01:45:21,921 --> 01:45:23,380
Wherever you are.

856
01:45:30,421 --> 01:45:31,421
Go to school.
